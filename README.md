# Dotfiles

This dotfiles utilize [chezmoi][1]. Be sure to [get it installed][2], then [read the basic usage][3]. Simple as that.

I haven't found the written docs, but as I observed it, it mostly depends on `git` as how it initialize a blank chezmoi or remote one. Be sure to get [Git][4] installed on your machine.

## What's inside?
TODO: list summary of contents.

## What's next?
This dotfiles won't install essential packages for you. You have to get it intalled yourself via proper package manager (or your own build). Check the [list of essentials][../blob/master/essentials.txt].

A package usually initialize its own config file(s) and might conflicts with this (easily can be fixed). Be sure to get this dotfiles initialized then install the package.
